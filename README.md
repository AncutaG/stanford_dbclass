# Stanford dbclass solutions


In this repository I've compiled my solutions for the exercises and quizzes that I did
during my completion of the (infamous) database class offered [here][1] (for free!) by 
[Prof. Jennifer Widom][2].

Solutions have been polished and sectioned according to the new format of the course (self-paced 
mini-courses). In each of the mini-courses there are `markdown` (`.md`) files which have both the 
solutions and as well as the accompanied code. Some queries, questions, and exercises have some 
personal notes that I've found interesting. As always, take everything with a *grain of salt*.

# Important notes

This course was by far the most educational course I've had in databases -- far 
exceeding in both quality and breadth the one that was offered by my University. 
I sincerely urge you to try and do these exercises yourself in order to get the most 
out of it... and... please... *avoid copy-pasta*. It decreases the value of the course 
for *you* and for others.
