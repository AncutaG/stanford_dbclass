# XSLT Chapter

In this chapter the notions of `XSLT` and it's syntax is covered. Graded assignments 
include quiz answers as well as some trivial exercises. The Course-Catalog and 
World-Country schemas that are used for the exercises are located [here][1] 
and [here][2] respectively. Generally speaking `XSLT` is significantly more 
challenging to get right than say, `XQuery`; especially if one is not used 
to it.

## Course-Catalog

The Course Catalog exercises are the following:

* Core-set: basic query formation, [here][3] (graded)
* Extra-set: basic and challenging queries, [here][4] (ungraded) 

## World-Country

The World Country exercises are the following:

* Core-set: basic query formation, [here][5] (graded)
* Extra-set: basic and challenging queries, [here][6] (ungraded)
