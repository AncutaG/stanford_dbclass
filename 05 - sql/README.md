# SQL Chapter

In this chapter the notions of `SQL` and it's syntax is covered. Graded assignments include
trivial and challenging exercises. The Movie-Rating and Social-Network database creation
scripts that are used for the exercises are located [here][1] and [here][2] respectively.

## Exercises

In this chapter; at least in my edition of the course (2014-) there are six (`6`) `SQL` 
exercises, covering data modification and query formation. Some exercises can be 
quite challenging.

* Core-set: basic query formation, [here][3] (graded)
* Extra-set: basic and challenging queries, [here][4] (ungraded)
* Modification: data manipulation (updates, deletions, insertions), [here][5] (ungraded)
