In this question, you are to create a `DTD` for a small `XML` data set drawn 
from the Stanford course catalog. There are multiple departments, each 
with a department chair, some courses, and professors and/or lecturers 
who teach courses. The XML data is here. 

Write a `DTD` for the `XML` data set. 

Important: Do not include `<!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]>` in your `DTD`. 
Your DTD should start with `<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>`.
