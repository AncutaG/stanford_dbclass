# XML Chapter

In this chapter the notions of `XML` and it's syntax is covered. Graded assignments include
quiz answers as well as some trivial exercises. The Course-Catalog and World-Country schemas
that are used for the exercises are located [here][5] and [here][4] respectively.

## Quizzes

## Exercises

In this chapter; at least in my edition of the course (2014-) there are three (`3`) `XML` 
exercises, mostly covering `DTD` formation; each of which can be found in these 
links: [Q1][1], [Q2][2], [Q3][3]. Needless to say, answers are included.
