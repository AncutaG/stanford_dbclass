# XML Chapter

In this chapter the notions of `XML` and it's syntax is covered. Graded assignments include
quiz answers as well as some trivial exercises. The Course-Catalog and World-Country schemas
that are used for the exercises are located [here][1] and [here][2] respectively.

## Quizzes

The quiz for the `XML` chapter includes some basic answers regarding how `XML` is 
formatted and matched against a `DTD`; answers are located [here][3]

## Exercises

In this chapter; at least in my edition of the course (2014-) there are three (3) `XML` 
exercises, mostly covering `DTD` formation; each of which can be found in these 
links: [Q1][4], [Q2][5], [Q3][6]. Needless to say, answers are included.
