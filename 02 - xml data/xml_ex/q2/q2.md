In this question, you are to create a `DTD` for a different version of the data 
set drawn from the Stanford course catalog. This version encodes the data using 
`ID` and `IDREF(S)` attributes. The `XML` data is [here][1]. 

Write a `DTD` for the `XML` data set. 

Hint: You may want to use your `DTD` from the previous question as a starting 
point, since the structure is similar. 

Important: Do not include `<!DOCTYPE Course_Catalog [...]>` in your DTD. 
Your `DTD` should start with `<!ELEMENT Course_Catalog (Department*)>`. 

Answer is located [here][2]
